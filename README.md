# Plc_monitor

This repo contains the implementation of a system for remote monitoring and control of [plcshield](https://github.com/pepemanboy/plcshield)

The system consists of two parts: software and firmware

## Software
Software consists of a web application, hosted in AWS.

This is the main tab, where the connected PLCs can be seen, added, or removed.

This is the visualization tab, where one can graph different signals of different PLCs.

This is the configuration tab, where one can configure the PLCs.

All software code is in the website folder.

## Firmware
Firmware consists of a C program, intended to be run in an arduino connected to the plcshield.

All firmware code is in the firmware folder and is self documented.

## Installation

1. Install the plcshield library and its associated external libraries, as explained in the documentation (https://github.com/pepemanboy/plcshield)

2. Open plc_monitor/arduino/plcmonitor/plcmonitor.ino file

3. Sketch -> Include library -> Manage libraries. Buscar "Ethernet". Escoger la version a instalar (2.0), y clic en instalar.

4. Ir a plc_config, y cambiar el PLC_ID al ID del PLC correspondiente. Dejar todo lo dem√°s igual (No mover IP ni nada)

5. Compilar para Arduino mega 2560

6. Seleccionar puerto

7. Download!
